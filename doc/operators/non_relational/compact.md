Remove tuple duplicates

SYNOPSIS

    #(signature)

DESCRIPTION

This non-relational operator removes duplicates from its input operand.
In other words, it converts a bag of tuples to a set of tuples in a 
brute-force manner.

If the presence of duplicates was the only "non-relational" aspect of 
the operand, the result is a valid relation.
